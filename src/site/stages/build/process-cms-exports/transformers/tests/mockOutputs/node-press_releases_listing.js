As always, the safety of our patients and employees is our top priority. Thank you for your patience as we adjust our policies as necessary to allow us to continue to provide safe care.</p>\n\n<h3>COVID-19 TESTING</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Call before reporting for testing</strong></p>\n\n<p>COVID-19 testing is by appointment only. If you have a sore throat, dry cough, shortness of breath or fever, call 412-360-6000 and select option #3 to speak to a nurse before visiting our facilities or to schedule an appointment for drive-through testing at University Drive. Do not report to the Emergency Department just for a test. Do not report for testing without an appointment. If you are having a medical emergency, call 911.</p>\n\n<h3>ENTRY INFORMATION</h3>\n\n<p><strong>All entrants should know we:</strong></p>\n\n<ul><li>Screen all patients, visitors, support persons, and employees at entrances.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Require everyone in our facilities to wear a face covering or mask when within 6 feet of another person. Bring your own or we will provide one. Please see CDC’s recommendations for cloth face masks. We will make an exception only for Veterans who have a documented medical condition that prevents them from wearing a face covering or mask. Other entrants who do not agree to wear a face covering or mask will not be admitted to our facilities.</li>\n</ul><ul><li>Eliminated valet services at the University Drive campus. Veteran parking has been expanded and personnel are available to assist patients to appointments, as needed.</li>\n</ul><h3><strong>VISITATION RESTRICTIONS</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Emergency Department</strong></p>\n\n<p>No visitors are permitted in Emergency Department waiting areas.

We will verify your identity before asking you to confirm your insurance information, address, emergency contact, etc. This new process is safer because it minimizes your face-to-face contact with administrative staff, once you arrive for your appointment. If you do not feel comfortable taking the call from us, you will have the option to call us back so you can be certain you are speaking with someone from VA Pittsburgh. You can even call us back after hours because we have staff in place who can preregister you. PLEASE NOTE: We will never ask you for your full Social Security number, credit card or bank information.</li>\n\t<li>You cannot bring a companion for an outpatient visit unless you need a support person. One support person may accompany outpatients who have physical or intellectual disabilities or are to be sedated for a procedure. Support persons must be 18 or older, pass COVID-19 screening and wear a face covering.</li>\n\t<li>When you arrive for your appointment, follow the directions on the posted signs to check in via VEText with your mobile phone. If you don\'t have a mobile phone, enter the building no sooner than 15 minutes prior to your appointment.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>You should arrive 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time for screening and clearance.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li>\n\t<p>Some surgeries or procedures may require a COVID test within 48 hours of your appointment.
